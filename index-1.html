<h1 id="iperfcon">iperfcon</h1>
<p>iperfcon is for Openshift/Kubernetes bandwidth testing the SDN network.
the iperf-client is working with the iperf-server container and outputs 
the iperf3 results summery after we run a GET command  to the iperf-client 
route with the right values.</p>
<p>we can use it for several used cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>network bandwidth within the worker</li>
<li>network bandwidth between 2 workers</li>
<li>network bandwidth between a Worker and and external Server</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="deploying-iperfcon">Deploying iperfcon</h2>
<p>the usage of the containers is very simple.</p>
<p>first let's build the namespace for them :</p>
<pre><code># oc new-project iperf
</code></pre>
<p>clone the github to your current working directory</p>
<pre><code># git clone https://github.com/randomparity/iperfcon.git
</code></pre>
<p>now let's run the deployment for both Deployments</p>
<pre><code># oc create -f iperfcon/iperf-server/pod-deployment.yaml
# oc create -f iperfcon/iperf-client/pod-deployment.yaml
</code></pre>
<p>now make sure the pods are deployed as you expected them to be :</p>
<pre><code># oc get pods -n iperf -o wide
</code></pre>
<p>if you want to check the communication between 2 workers make sure the pods are spraed out</p>
<ul>
<li>create a service for the iperf-server with port 5001 and a service for the iperf-client with port 8080</li>
<li>create a route for the iperf-client</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-use-it">How to Use it</h2>
<p>now run the curl command to the route to get the results:</p>
<pre><code># curl -X GET http://iperf-client-router/iperf/api.cgi?server=iperf-server-service,port=5001,type=json
</code></pre>
<p>The RESTAPI only expect a GET request with the following values :</p>
<ul>
<li>server - the iperf-server service IP address or name</li>
<li>port - the port you are using on the iperf-server (the default is 5001)</li>
<li>type - the type of output you want to see , that can be either HTML or JSON (lowercap latter ONLY!!)</li>
</ul>
<p>if you want to look at the results in a nicer output you can pipe it to jq</p>
<pre><code># curl -X GET  http://iperf-client-router/iperf/api.cgi?server=iperf-server-service,port=5001,type=json | jq
</code></pre>
